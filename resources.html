            <td>This article written by Manisha Priyadarshini from Fossbytes briefly describes different sensors that smartphones commonly have and how they are used in the real world. 
                The sensors range from mundane sensors like GPS and Fingerprint sensors to more exotic sensors like Geiger Counters and Air Humidity sensors. This article would be useful for my class because 
                it shows how some of the most common sensors on smartphones are used in the real world which can give me inspiration for my own projects that take advantage of sensors. However, this article 
                does not show how to use each sensor in mobile development so I would still need to look elsewhere.

                This article written by The JetRuby Agency on Jetruby.com is a step by step guide on how to implement a fingerprint scanner into an android application. It focuses on the FingerprintAPI and classes within this API like FIngerprintManager and
                FingerprintManagerCompat that are used for interfacing an android phone's fingerprint sensor with an application. For security, the use of Android KeyStore is shown to help keep fingerprint information secure. A KeyPairGenerator is created from KeyStore
                to implement an encryptor and decryptor that helps store fingerprint data. The article shows the code that is used to complete these tasks and explains in great detail the process of implementing this fingerprint sensor solution. 
                <br>
                This article will be very useful as it explains both the concepts and code that I might need to know to implement fingerprint sensors in an application. Especially since I am considering using fingerprint sensors for upcoming mobile development projects.

                This article written by Enzo Lizama from Medium.com explores the use of accelerometers in Android Studio via Kotlin. 
                <br>
                The article starts with explaining what an accelerometer is and the kind of demo that will be created in the article. The entire source code of the application is also provided. 
                <br>
                While the source code and background information on accelerometers is useful, it does not explain in great detail how the code works or how it all fits together in the context  of accelerometers. Perhaps I might find use of the source code after 
                reading over it myself.

                This article written by Sam Costello on Lifewire.com briefly describes the different sensors that exist on iPhones and how they are used. While most of the sensors on here are common amongst all smartphones, the article does
                also talk about iPhone-specific sensor features like Face ID which can provide authentication for Apple services like Apple Pay. 
                <br>
                In terms of overall usefulness, this article would be moderately useful in the sense that, while I might not be doing very much iPhone development, it would be good for me to be aware of iPhone sensors and their features so that in the 
                case that I do end up working with iPhones, I would be more informed of what sensor features are at my disposal.
